  "informal_proof": "Say $a^n + b^n = c^n$ is a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem. Every positive integer is either a power of 2 or has an odd prime factor. If $n=kp$ has an odd prime factor $p$ then $(a^k)^p+(b^k)^p=(c^k)^p$ is the counterexample we seek. It remains to deal with the case where $n$ is a power of 2, so let's assume this. We have $3\\leq n$ by assumption, so $n=4k$ must be a multiple of~4, and thus $(a^k)^4=(b^k)^4=(c^k)^4$, giving us a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem for $n=4$. However theorem \\ref{FermatLastTheoremFour} says that $x^4+y^4=z^4$ has no solutions in positive integers."

  "informal_proof": "Suppose we have a counterexample $a^p+b^p=c^p$ for the given $p$; we now build a Frey package from this data.\n If the greatest common divisor of $a,b,c$ is $d$ then $a^p+b^p=c^p$ implies $(a/d)^p+(b/d)^p=(c/d)^p$. Dividing through, we can thus assume that no prime divides all of $a,b,c$. Under this assumption we must have that $a,b,c$ are pairwise coprime, as if some prime divides two of the integers $a,b,c$ then by $a^p+b^p=c^p$ and unique factorization it must divide all three of them. In particular we may assume that not all of $a,b,c$ are even, and now reducing modulo~2 shows that precisely one of them must be even.\n Next we show that we can find a counterexample with $b$ even. If $a$ is the even one then we can just switch $a$ and $b$. If $c$ is the even one then we can replace $c$ by $-b$ and $b$ by $-c$ (using that $p$ is odd).\n The last thing to ensure is that $a$ is 3 mod~4. Because $b$ is even, we know that $a$ is odd, so it is either~1 or~3 mod~4. If $a$ is 3 mod~4 then we are home; if however $a$ is 1 mod~4 we replace $a,b,c$ by their negatives and this is the Frey package we seek."
